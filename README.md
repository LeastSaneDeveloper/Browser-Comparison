# Browser Comparison

## Introduction

I made this repository to provide a comparison of modern browsers, evaluating them across multiple metrics including privacy, security, performance, and compatibility with modern web standards.

With the information in this project, (hopefully) you will be able to make an informed choice. The goal is not to find a single “best” browser, the goal is to find the one which suits your threat model.
